## Types of Vectors
In this chapter, I would learn about the type of vectors. There are basically 4 types of vectors. That is logical (TRUE- FALSE), Integer (non decimal values, NaN and Inf, -Inf), Double (decimal values) and Character.

Vector that is the same type of elements is Atomic Vector. Otherwise it is a list.
```{r}
lgl_var <- c(TRUE, FALSE)
int_var <- c(1L, 6L, 10L)
dbl_var <- c(1, 2.5, 4.5)
chr_var <- c("these are", "some strings")
```

To get the type of the vector, we would use the function typeof()

```{r}
typeof(lgl_var)
typeof(int_var)
typeof(dbl_var)
typeof(chr_var)
```
## Missing values
Calculation with NA are mostly NA. Excepting some cases

```{r}
NA + 10
NA *10
NA < 10
!NA
```

NA is something between TRUE and FALSE. Let's see it. When doing with TRUE and FALSE, | returns in TRUE & returns in FALSE. NA is in between.
```{r}
NA| TRUE
NA & TRUE
NA | FALSE
NA & FALSE
```
```{r}
NA ^ 0
```
Checking if NA equal NA or other numbers. Returns all in NA.

```{r}
x <- c(NA, 1, NA, 2)
x == NA
```

## Testing and Coercion

We can use the function is.*() to test the type of a vector. But it applies to is.logical(), is.integer(), is.double() and is.character()

```{r}
is.logical(lgl_var)
is.integer(lgl_var)
is.double(dbl_var)
is.character(chr_var)
```
Check carefully if you use these tests below by reading their documentation:
```{r}
is.vector(lgl_var)
is.numeric(chr_var)
is.atomic(dbl_var)
```

When combining different type of vector into one vector, the type of the vector will be corerced into this order: character > double > integer > logical.
```{r}
typeof(c(lgl_var, dbl_var))
typeof(c(lgl_var, chr_var))
typeof(c(chr_var, int_var))
```
Coercing into integer will make the element that is character becomes NA
```{r}
mixed_var <- c(chr_var, int_var)
typeof(mixed_var)
as.integer(mixed_var)
```
## Attributes

We can set name pair attributes for any variable. Attribute can be strings or numeric.
```{r}
a <- 1:3
attr(a, "x") <- "abcdef"
attr(a, "x")

attr(a, "y") <- 4:6
str(attributes(a))

# Or equivalently:
a <- structure(1:3, x = "abcdef", y = 4:6)
str(attributes(a))
```
There are 2 attributes that is generally preserved. It is names (character vector giving each elements a name) and dim (short for dimension, used to turn vectors into matrices or arrays).

## Names

We have a few way to creates name
```{r}
# Create name at the beginning
x <- c("a" = 1, "b" = 2, "c" = 3)
x
# Create a names vector
y = 1:3
names(y) = c("a", "b", "c")
y

# Inline with setNames()
z <- setNames(1:3, c("a", "b", "c"))
z
```

## Dimensions

```{r}
# setting matrix
x <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
x

y <- array(1:12, c(2, 3, 2))
y
```

We can also modify the dim to set the object
```{r}
z <- 1:6
dim(z) <- c(2, 3)
z
```
Vector, Matrix and Array have the functions as below.

A vector without a dim attribute is often thought as 1 dimension, but actually NULL dimension.
We can also have matrix with one row or one column (row or column vector) with single dimension.
We can reveal the difference in str() function
```{r}
str(c(1:3))
str(matrix(1:3, ncol = 1))
str(matrix(1:3, nrow = 1))
str(array(1:3, 3))
```
