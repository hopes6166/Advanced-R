# Advanced-R
This is my personal notebook to study R. I am a Python programmer and now study R from scratch, using the book Advanced R by Hadley Wickham. Thanks for the great work again.
I will write this one both in Rmarkdown and the convertible Rmarkdown PDF file where people can easily print out and work on.
